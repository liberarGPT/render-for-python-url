By deploying specialized LLM-powered agents working collaboratively, the platform evaluates market conditions across multiple asset classes and executes informed trading decisions through the Alpaca API.

Trading performance may vary based on many factors, including the chosen backbone language models, model temperature, trading periods, the quality of data, and other non-deterministic factors. [It is not intended as financial, investment, or trading advice.](https://tauric.ai/disclaimer/)

Our enhanced framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles while providing real-time market connectivity and execution capabilities.

## AlpacaTradingAgent Package

### Implementation Details

Built with LangGraph for flexibility and modularity. The enhanced version integrates with multiple financial APIs and supports both paper and live trading through Alpaca. We recommend using `gpt-5-mini` for testing to minimize API costs, as the framework makes numerous API calls across all 5 agents.

### Python Usage

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Initialize with default config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# Analyze a single stock
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)

# Analyze multiple assets including crypto
symbols = ["NVDA", "ETH/USD", "AAPL"]
for symbol in symbols:
    _, decision = ta.propagate(symbol, "2024-05-10")
    print(f"{symbol}: {decision}")
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Create custom config for enhanced features
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["deep_think_llm"] = "gpt-5-mini"  # Cost-effective for testing
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-5-mini"
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 2  # Increase debate rounds
config["online_tools"] = True  # Use real-time data
config["enable_margin_trading"] = True  # Allow short selling
config["auto_execute_trades"] = False  # Manual approval required

# Initialize with custom config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)

# Analyze with crypto support
_, decision = ta.propagate("BTC/USD", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)
```
